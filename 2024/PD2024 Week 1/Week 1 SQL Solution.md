## 2024: Week 1 - Prep Air's Flow Card

January 03, 2024
Created by: Carl Allchin

At Preppin' Data we use a number of (mock) companies to look at the challenges they have with their data. For January, we're going to focus on our own airline, Prep Air. The airline has introduced a new loyalty card called the Flow Card. We need to clean up a number of data sets to determine how well the card is doing. 

The first task is setting some context for later weeks by understanding how popular the Flow Card is. Our stakeholder would like two data sets about our passengers. One data set for card users and one data set for those who don't use the card. 

**Requirements**
- Input the data
- Split the Flight Details field to form:
  - Date
  - Flight Number
  - From
  - To
  - Class
  - Price
- Convert the following data fields to the correct data types:
  - Date to a date format
  - Price to a decimal value
- Change the Flow Card field to Yes / No values instead of 1 / 0
- Create two tables, one for Flow Card holders and one for non-Flow Card holders
- Output the data sets
